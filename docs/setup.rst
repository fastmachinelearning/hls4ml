Setup
=====

This chapter is dedicated to setting up the tool.  We discuss software dependencies of ``hls4ml``.  There is a quick start guide for beginners to get familiar quickly.  Then we discuss in more detail the features of the tool and user configuration.

Dependencies
============

**numpy, h5py**\ : required for the translation of keras model files 

http://www.numpy.org

http://www.h5py.org 


**pyyaml**\ : for configuration file parsing 

https://pypi.python.org/pypi/PyYAML 

**QKeras**\ : for working with quantized models 

https://github.com/google/qkeras

**PyTorch**\ : for reading in Torch models

https://pytorch.org/


**onnx**\ : note that you need an install of protobuf and numpy to build onnx. Detailed instructions are included in the link. 

https://github.com/onnx/onnx 


**Xilinx Vivado license**\ : a license is required for the synthesis of generated RTL IP


Quick Start
=============

For basic concepts to understand the tool, please visit the :doc:`Concepts <concepts>` chapter. Here we give line-by-line instructions for simply running the tool out-of-the-box and getting a feel for the workflow.  

Installation
------------

.. code-block::

   pip install hls4ml

If you want to use our :doc:`profiling <api/profiling>` toolbox, you might need to install extra dependencies:

.. code-block::

   pip install hls4ml[profiling]

Getting started
---------------

To get started with ``hls4ml``, we provide some default example models for conversion:

.. code-block:: python

   import hls4ml

   #Fetch a keras model from our example repository
   #This will download our example model to your working directory and return an example configuration file
   config = hls4ml.utils.fetch_example_model('KERAS_3layer.json')

   print(config) #You can print it to see some default parameters

   #Convert it to a hls project
   hls_model = hls4ml.converters.keras_to_hls(config)

   # Print full list of example model if you want to explore more
   hls4ml.utils.fetch_example_list()

After that, you can use :code:`Vivado HLS` to synthesize the model:

.. code-block:: python

   #Use Vivado HLS to synthesize the model
   #This might take several minutes
   hls_model.build()

   #Print out the report if you want
   hls4ml.report.read_vivado_report('my-hls-test')

Done! you've built your first project using ``hls4ml`` ! To learn more about our various API functionalities, check out our tutorials `here <https://github.com/fastmachinelearning/hls4ml-tutorial>`__.

If you want to configure your model further, check out our :doc:`Configuration <api/configuration>` page. 

Apart from our main API, we also support model conversion using a command line interface, check out our next section to find out more:

Getting started with hls4ml commands (optional)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

To follow this tutorial, you must first download our ``example-models`` repository:

.. code-block:: bash

   git clone https://github.com/fastmachinelearning/example-models.git

The model files, along with other configuration parameters, are defined in the ``.yml`` files.
Further information about ``.yml`` files can be found in :doc:`Configuration <api/configuration>` page.

In order to create an example HLS project:


Go to ``example-models/`` from the main directory: 

.. code-block:: bash

   cd example-models/


And use this command to translate a Keras model:

.. code-block:: bash

   hls4ml convert -c keras-config.yml

This will create a new HLS project directory with an implementation of a model from the ``example-models/keras/`` directory.
To build the HLS project, do:

.. code-block:: bash

   hls4ml build -p my-hls-test -a

This will create a Vivado HLS project with your model implmentation!

**NOTE:** For the last step, you can alternatively do the following to build the HLS project:

.. code-block:: Bash

   cd my-hls-test
   vivado_hls -f build_prj.tcl

``vivado_hls`` can be controlled with:

.. code-block:: bash

   vivado_hls -f build_prj.tcl "csim=1 synth=1 cosim=1 export=1"

Setting the additional parameters to ``1`` to ``0`` disables that step, but disabling ``synth`` also disables ``cosim`` and ``export``.

Further help
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^


* 
  For further information about how to use ``hls4ml``\ , do: ``hls4ml --help`` or ``hls4ml -h``

* 
  If you need help for a particular ``command``\ , ``hls4ml command -h`` will show help for the requested ``command``

* 
  We provide a detailed documentation for each of the command in the :doc:`Command Help <../command>` section

Uninstalling
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

To uninstall ``hls4ml``: 

.. code-block:: bash

   pip uninstall hls4ml
