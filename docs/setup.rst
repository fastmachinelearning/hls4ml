=====================
Setup and Quick Start
=====================

Getting started with ``hls4ml`` is very easy. There are several installation options available and once installed,
it takes only a few lines of code to run your first synthesis.

Installation
============

The latest release of ``hls4ml`` can be installed with ``pip``:

.. code-block::

   pip install hls4ml

If you want to use our :doc:`profiling <api/profiling>` toolbox, you might need to install extra dependencies:

.. code-block::

   pip install hls4ml[profiling]

``hls4ml`` is also available as a ``conda`` package in the ``conda-forge`` repository. To install, run:

.. code-block::

   conda install -c conda-forge hls4ml

Development version
-------------------

``hls4ml`` is rapidly evolving and many experimental features and bugfixes are available on the development branch. Development
version can be installed directly from ``git``:

.. code-block::

   pip install git+https://github.com/fastmachinelearning/hls4ml@main


Dependencies
============

The ``hls4ml`` library depends on a number of Python packages and external tools for synthesis and simulation. Python dependencies are automatically managed
by ``pip`` or ``conda``.

* `TensorFlow <https://pypi.org/project/tensorflow/>`_ (version 2.4 and newer) and `QKeras <https://pypi.org/project/qkeras/>`_ are required by the Keras converter.
* `ONNX <https://pypi.org/project/onnx/>`_ (version 1.4.0 and newer) is required by the ONNX converter.
* `PyTorch <https://pytorch.org/get-started>`_ package is optional. If not installed, the PyTorch converter will not be available.

Running C simulation from Python requires a C++11-compatible compiler. On Linux, a GCC C++ compiler ``g++`` is required. Any version from a recent
Linux should work. On MacOS, the *clang*-based ``g++`` is enough.

To run FPGA synthesis, installation of following tools is required:

* Xilinx Vivado HLS 2018.2 to 2020.1 for synthesis for Xilinx FPGAs

  * Vitis HLS 2022.1 or newer is required for synthesis for Xilinx FPGAs using the experimental ``Vitis`` backend.

* Intel Quartus 20.1 to 21.4 for the synthesis for Intel FPGAs


Quick Start
=============

For basic concepts to understand the tool, please visit the :doc:`Concepts <concepts>` chapter.
Here we give line-by-line instructions to demonstrate the general workflow.

.. code-block:: python

   import hls4ml

   # Fetch a keras model from our example repository
   # This will download our example model to your working directory and return an example configuration file
   config = hls4ml.utils.fetch_example_model('KERAS_3layer.json')

   # You can print it to see some default parameters
   print(config)

   # Convert it to a hls project
   hls_model = hls4ml.converters.keras_to_hls(config)

   # Print full list of example model if you want to explore more
   hls4ml.utils.fetch_example_list()

After that, you can use :code:`Vivado HLS` to synthesize the model:

.. code-block:: python

   # Use Vivado HLS to synthesize the model
   # This might take several minutes
   hls_model.build()

   # Print out the report if you want
   hls4ml.report.read_vivado_report('my-hls-test')

Done! You've built your first project using ``hls4ml``! To learn more about our various API functionalities, check out our tutorials `here <https://github.com/fastmachinelearning/hls4ml-tutorial>`__.

If you want to configure your model further, check out our :doc:`Configuration <api/configuration>` page.

Apart from our main API, we also support model conversion using a command line interface, check out our next section to find out more:

Getting started with hls4ml CLI (deprecated)
--------------------------------------------

As an alternative to the recommended Python PI, the command-line interface is provided via the ``hls4ml`` command.

To follow this tutorial, you must first download our ``example-models`` repository:

.. code-block:: bash

   git clone https://github.com/fastmachinelearning/example-models

Alternatively, you can clone the ``hls4ml`` repository with submodules

.. code-block:: bash

   git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/fastmachinelearning/hls4ml

The model files, along with other configuration parameters, are defined in the ``.yml`` files.
Further information about ``.yml`` files can be found in :doc:`Configuration <api/configuration>` page.

In order to create an example HLS project, first go to ``example-models/`` from the main directory:

.. code-block:: bash

   cd example-models/

And use this command to translate a Keras model:

.. code-block:: bash

   hls4ml convert -c keras-config.yml

This will create a new HLS project directory with an implementation of a model from the ``example-models/keras/`` directory.
To build the HLS project, do:

.. code-block:: bash

   hls4ml build -p my-hls-test -a

This will create a Vivado HLS project with your model implementation!

**NOTE:** For the last step, you can alternatively do the following to build the HLS project:

.. code-block:: Bash

   cd my-hls-test
   vivado_hls -f build_prj.tcl

``vivado_hls`` can be controlled with:

.. code-block:: bash

   vivado_hls -f build_prj.tcl "csim=1 synth=1 cosim=1 export=1 vsynth=1"

Setting the additional parameters from ``1`` to ``0`` disables that step, but disabling ``synth`` also disables ``cosim`` and ``export``.

Further help
^^^^^^^^^^^^

* For further information about how to use ``hls4ml``\ , do: ``hls4ml --help`` or ``hls4ml -h``
* If you need help for a particular ``command``\ , ``hls4ml command -h`` will show help for the requested ``command``
* We provide a detailed documentation for each of the command in the :doc:`Command Help <../command>` section

Existing examples
-----------------

* Examples of model files and weights can be found in `example_models <https://github.com/fastmachinelearning/example-models>`_ directory.
* Training codes and examples of resources needed to train the models can be found in the `tutorial <https://github.com/fastmachinelearning/hls4ml-tutorial>`__.

Uninstalling
------------

To uninstall ``hls4ml``:

.. code-block:: bash

   pip uninstall hls4ml

If installed with ``conda``, remove the package with:

.. code-block:: bash

   conda remove hls4ml
