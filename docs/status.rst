Features
========

A list of supported ML frameworks, HLS backends, and neural network architectures, including a summary table is below.  Dependencies are given in the :doc:`Setup <setup>` page.

ML framework support:

* (Q)Keras
* PyTorch (limited)
* (Q)ONNX (in development)

Neural network architectures:

* Fully connected NN (multilayer perceptron, MLP)
* Convolutional NN
* Recurrent NN (LSTM)
* Graph NN (GarNet)

HLS backends:

* Vivado HLS
* Intel HLS
* Vitis HLS (experimental)

A summary of the on-going status of the ``hls4ml`` tool is in the table below.

Other feature notes:

* ``hls4ml`` is tested on Linux, and supports
   * Vivado HLS versions 2018.2 to 2020.1
   * Intel HLS versions 20.1 to 21.4
   * Vitis HLS versions 2020.2 to 2022.2 (experimentally)
* Windows and macOS are not supported
* BDT support has moved to the `Conifer <https://github.com/thesps/conifer>`__ package

Example Models
==============

We also provide and document several example ``hls4ml`` models in `this GitHub repository <https://github.com/fastmachinelearning/example-models>`_, which is included as a submodule.
You can check it out by doing ``git submodule update --init --recursive`` from the top level directory of ``hls4ml``.
