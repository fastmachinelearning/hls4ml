    '''
    Function for removing zero neurons & filters from a model and rewiring the model graph
    This function is built on top of Keras Surgeon available at: https://github.com/BenWhetton/keras-surgeon
    Keras Surgeon is no longer under active development and does not work for TensorFlow 2.3+ and QKeras
    The baseline version was forked and updated, available at: https://github.com/fastmachinelearning/keras-surgeon

    IMPORTANT: To use this funcionality please install separately from the above GitHub.

    Args:
        model (keras.model): Input model

    Returns:
        reduced (keras.model): Modified model, with redundant structures removed
