*     (1) io_parallel:
               - Top-level function takes a struct containing an array as function argument
               - Returns a struct containing an array - the prediction
      (2) io_stream:
               - Top-level function is 'void' - no return value
               - Instead, both the input and output are passed by reference
               - This is due the HLS Streaming Interfaces; stream cannot be copied (implicitly deleted copy constructor)
* This distinction is handled in quartus_writer.py
